    <h1>Let me tell you a little about myself!</h1>
    <article>My name is Robert, I was born and raised in the DFW(Dallas Fort-Worth) area in Texas. I haven't really ventured to far out of Texas unless its to go to Oklahoma to go to Winstar.
        I'm currently enrolled in the DevMountain program and loving every second of it. I work a part-time job for Wal-mart at a fulfillment center(currently overnight shifts).
        My hobbies consist of building model kits, playing video games, playing with my mini-pitbull Nestle and spending time with my close friends. P.S. I also love anime!
